# 'Mines of Moria' HTML5 demo by [@itsravenous](http://twitter.com/itsravenous) #

This demo uses a variety of HTML5 jazziness, including <audio>, CSS 3d transforms & animation and speech recognition via the Web Speech API.
It was part of a larger treasure hunt my brother and I put on for our cousins, the other components of which may surface in time.
